When chunking Confluence pages for a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system, consider strategies like content-aware chunking to split based on section headers and content types (like tables), semantic text splitting to identify natural boundaries based on meaning, agentic chunking to use an LLM to create chunks according to specific instructions, and sliding window chunking for overlapping chunks to preserve contextual continuity; always monitor performance metrics to optimize chunk size based on your specific Confluence data. 
Key points about chunking Confluence pages for RAG:

Content-aware chunking:
Identify distinct content types like headings, lists, tables, and paragraphs within a page. 
Create separate chunks for each content type to ensure relevant retrieval based on query type. 

Semantic text splitting:
Utilize NLP techniques to identify semantic boundaries within the text, like topic shifts or key phrases. 
This helps create chunks with coherent meaning, improving retrieval accuracy. 

Agentic chunking:
Use an LLM to dynamically create chunks based on specific rules or instructions. 
For example, you could instruct the LLM to create a chunk for each bullet point within a list. 

Sliding window chunking:
Divide the text into overlapping chunks, ensuring some context is preserved across chunk boundaries. 
Useful when dealing with complex topics where information might span multiple sections. 
Other chunking strategies to consider:

Naive chunking: A basic approach where you split text into chunks based on a fixed character count or sentence count. 

Paragraph chunking: Splitting each paragraph into a separate chunk. 

Hierarchical chunking: Creating nested chunks with parent-child relationships for complex document structures. 
Important factors to consider when chunking Confluence pages:

Chunk size:
Find the optimal chunk size that balances retrieval accuracy with processing efficiency. 

Context preservation:
Ensure that chunks retain enough context to provide meaningful information when retrieved. 

Performance monitoring:
Track metrics like retrieval accuracy, processing time, and memory usage to fine-tune your chunking strategy
